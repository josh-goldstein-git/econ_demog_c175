# DEMOG C175: Economic Demography


## R and RStudio

As an alternative to the Demography Rstudio server, we recommend using 
[Berkeley's R Datahub](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/). Another option is to install the software on your own computer though course staff cannot help with technical issues that may arise with installation.

### Using Berkeley's R Datahub

- Log into the Berkeley R Datahub with your calnet credentials. 
[https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/)
    - To **upload** files click on the upload button in the bottom right 
pane:

    - To **download** files, make sure the box next to the file(s) you 
want to download is ticked, click on the gear icon and select 'Export...' 
from the drop-down menu.

### Install the software on your own computer

 If you prefer to manage your own software, you also have the option to install R and RStudio on your own computer. This involves _two steps_:
  - First, install R based on your operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux) here: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).
  - Next, download RStudio (RStudio Desktop Free version): [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
