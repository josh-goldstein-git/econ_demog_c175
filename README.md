# DEMOG C175: Economic Demography

## Copy latest lab to your Datahub account and open Datahub üëâüèº [![Repo on DataHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch-UCB%20Datahub-blue.svg)](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjosh-goldstein-git%2Fecon_demog_c175&urlpath=rstudio%2F)
(Note: this button will actually copy all of the labs that have been released. We recommend adding your initials to the lab and resaving it, so that your own copy has no risk of being overwritten later in the semester. For example, rename "lab_01_world_2024.Rmd" to "myname_lab_01_world_2024.Rmd".)


## R and RStudio

For this course we will use 
[Berkeley's R Datahub](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/). 

### Resources for Getting Started with R

We recommend 

- [Getting Started in R tutorial](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/gsir-te/Getting-Started-in-R.pdf) (Just pages 1-3)
- [Intro to R video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP) (just the first 6 videos -- only about 15 mins total)

### Using Berkeley's R Datahub

- Log into the Berkeley R Datahub with your calnet credentials. 
[https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/)
(Note: the button at the top that copied the latest lab will open up Datahub automatically. But after you get the lab, you probably want to log-in directly, rather than recopy all of the labs.)

## Shiny Apps

All of the shiny apps we use can be run from these links. Not all of the are required for answering specific lab questions, but all are useful in learning the material.

<!-- ### Install the software on your own computer

 If you prefer to manage your own software, you also have the option to install R and RStudio on your own computer. This involves _two steps_:
  - First, install R based on your operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux) here: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).
  - Next, download RStudio (RStudio Desktop Free version): [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
