# Overview

Sweden has the longest historical series of reliable vital statistics
in the world. The Human Mortality Database, founded at Berkeley, has
records for counts of births, deaths, and population size since 1751,
well before the demographic transition.


Malthus visited Norway and Sweden and describes his travels in his 2nd
edition of (An Essay on the Principle of
Population). [http://www.econlib.org/library/Malthus/malPlong7.html#Bk.II.Ch.I]. Please
read these two chapters (Book II, Chapter I, "On the Checks to
Population in Norway" paragraphs II.I.1 through II.I.8; and Chapter
II, "On the Checks to Population in Sweden" paragraphs II.II.1 through
II.II.9) for a better understanding about Malthus's thinking on how
the environment and human custom interact to produce demographic
outcomes.


In this lab, our goals are:

1. To assess if the 18th century Swedish series of births and deaths is
consistent with Malthusian theory and see if we can detect a weakening
of Malthusian regime in the 19th and 20th centuries.

2. To learn how to use custom functions like malthus.plot.fun() by
   changing their arguments (without rewriting the functions themselves).

3. To use the non-graded interactive questions we have written for you
(e.g., Q.1.1, Q.1.2).

Note: there are TWO types of questions in Lab 2. First, we have the
non-graded interactive questions in the special code chunks (which we
did not have in Lab 1). These you do in RStudio. The goal of these is
to help your learning of the material, not to assess you. Second, as
in Lab 1, we have questions at the end that will be graded. These you
submit.



# Part 0: Import the data


```{r}

## Note: you need to run this code to do the lab. But understanding it
## is optional.

## Read in the data from a file on our server
df <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh-goldstein-git/econ_demog_c175_2023/main/data/SWE_pop_birth_death.txt", header =T)


## Display the first few rows of the object "df"
head(df)

## Create a separate object for population size, births, deaths, and year.
## Note: "read.table()" imports as a "data.frame", which stores each
## column of a data set as a separate element, which can be accessed
## with the dollar-sign, as below.
N <- df$N                               # population size
B <- df$B                               # births
D <- df$D                               # deaths
year <- rownames(df)

## Note: N, B, D, and year are vectors. In the last lab we used ".vec"
##   in the names of the vectors. Here we omit this to make our code
##   more readable.

```


# Part 1: Inspect and understand the data

Plot the history of Swedish population size, counts of births, and counts of deaths.

```{r}
plot(year, N, type = "l")
```

Q1.1 How big is the population of Sweden in 1800

A.  about 20 thousand

B.  about 200 thousand

C.  about 2 million

D.  about 20 million

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.1 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.1)
```

To get a more readable plot we can change units
```{r}
million = 1000000
N.millions <- N/million
plot(year, N.millions, type = "l")
```

Q1.2 What is the average (exponential) growth rate of Sweden from 1751
to 2014.
```{r}
( log(N[year == "2014"]) - log(N[year == "1751"]) )/ (2014 - 1751)
```
Which value is this closest to?

A.  1 percent

B.  6 percent

C.  0.5 percent

D.  0.005 percent.

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.2 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.2)
```


```{r}
# plot of Deaths by year, with type = "line"
plot(x = year, y = D, type = "l")
```

Q1.3. In what year did Sweden have the most deaths?

A.  In about 2000, because the population age structure shifted to older ages.

B.  In about 1850

C.  In 1773

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.3 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.3)
```


Plot the births using code similar the code for deaths, which is given
below. (Hint: You just need to replace the "y" variable.)
```{r}
# This is the code for deaths by year (modify it slightly).
plot(x = year, y = B, type = "l")
```

Q1.4 When were births at their low?

A.  In the great depression (1930s)

B.  In the low fertility of the economic recession at the end of the 1990s.

C.  In about 1773

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.4 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.4)
```



# Part 2: Time trends in crude rates (per capita births and deaths)

Let's get the births and deaths on a per capita basis. Demographers
call these crude rates. ("Crude" because we don't refine the
population at risk -- for example, we include women and men in the
denominator of the birth rate.)

```{r get.rates, fig.height=5}
cbr = B/N                               # crude birth rate
cdr = D/N                               # crude death rate
par(mfrow = c(2,1))                     # two panels in one plot
plot(year, cbr, type = "l", main = "Crude birth rates, Sweden")
plot(year, cdr, type = "l", main = "Crude death rates, Sweden")
```

Q2.1 The time trends in this plot are:

A.  Basically the same as the counts

B.  Quite different from the counts

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer2.1 = NA
quiz.check(answer2.1)
```

Q2.2. In what year was the peak death rate

A.  In the same year as the peak number of births

B.  In the the most recent year

C.  In 1773, the same year as the peak number of deaths

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer2.2 = NA
quiz.check(answer2.2)
```

Q2.3 Google "1773 Sweden". What happened in this year?

A.  There was a war

B.  There was a famine

C.  The borders of Sweden changed.

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer2.3 = NA
quiz.check(answer2.3)
```


# Part 3: Detecting Malthusian dynamics

In class, we showed the two-panel graphical explanation of the
Malthusian model. In the upper panel, we showed the relationship
between wages and birth and death rates. In the lower panel, we showed
the relationship between population size and wages. Together, these
two panels create the feedback loop for a very low growth Malthusian
economy and population.

Here, we will look at whether one part of the Malthusian world appears
to hold: that births and deaths go in opposite directions in good and
bad times. We don't have a measure of wages, so our inference is going
to be indirect, looking at the relationship between births and deaths
by year.

Q3.1. What relationship between births and deaths would be consistent
with a Malthusian economy?

A.  As births go up, deaths go up

B.  As birth rates go up, deaths rates go up

C.  As births go down, deaths go up

D.  As birth rates go down, death rates go up.

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer3.1 = NA
quiz.check(answer3.1)
```

```{r}
malthus.plot.fun <- function(from.year, to.year)
{
  ## a scatter plot of crude birth and death rates
  ## note: this function assumes that cdr and cbr already exist.
  ## If you're having problems, try running the code chunk above
  ## that creates the cbr and cdr
  my.years <- from.year:to.year
  s <- year %in% my.years
  plot(cdr[s], cbr[s], type = "n",
       xlab = "Crude death rate", ylab = "Crude birth rate")
  abline(lm(cbr ~ cdr, subset = s))
  text(cdr[s], cbr[s], year[s], cex = .5)
  my.cor <- round(cor(cdr[s], cbr[s]), 2)
  title(paste("Birth and Death Rates in Sweden, from", from.year,
              "to", to.year, "\n Correlation:", my.cor))
}

## now let's plot the first 50 years
malthus.plot.fun(from.year = 1751, to.year = 1800)
```
Q3.2 Which of the patterns in Q3.1 (A,B,C,or,D) does this match most closely?

```{r}
##  "Replace the 'NA' with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer3.2 = 'D'
quiz.check(answer3.2)
```


Q3.3 Is the pattern seen from 1751 to 1800 consistent with Malthusian theory?

A. Yes

B. No

```{r}
##  "Replace the 'NA' with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer3.3 = NA
quiz.check(answer3.3)
```

We see that birth rates are low when death rates are high (e.g.,
in 1772 and 1773). Even if we ignore these unusual years,
there is a generally negative relationship. Now plot the relationship
for the following time periods.

1801-1850
```{r}
## Modify the code we used for 1751 to 1800 appropriately.
malthus.plot.fun(from.year = 1751, to.year = 1800)
```
1851-1900
```{r}
## Modify the code we used for 1751 to 1800 appropriately.
malthus.plot.fun(from.year = 1751, to.year = 1800)
```
1901-2014
```{r}
## Modify the code we used for 1751 to 1800 appropriately.
malthus.plot.fun(from.year = 1751, to.year = 1800)
```

# Part 4: Lab write up. Please limit each answer to 50 words or less.

> Questions 4 and 5: Ireland and the Potato

> Potatoes are relatively easy to grow and can be stored year-round to

> In the Malthus app accessible from the class GitHub page:

>    after the potato is introduced? What happens to birth and death
>    rates? (Describe the direction of change – you don’t have to give
>    precise numbers.)
	
> 5. According to Malthus, in the long term, should the population of
>    Ireland return to its initial size? Why or why not?

> Questions 6 to 8: pen-and-paper questions
	
> 6. On a separate sheet of paper, draw your own Malthusian graph
>    system. (We recommend drawing by hand, as you may be asked to
>    draw this kind of graph on the exams without the aid of a
>    computer.) The top graph should show birth and death rates as a
>    function of wages; the bottom graph should show population size
>    as a function of wages. Label all of the axes and mark the
>    equilibrium state on both graphs by marking b*, d*, w*, and N*
>    (equilibrium birth rate, death rate, wage rate, and population
>    size) on the appropriate axes.

> 7. Imagine that marriage norms change and people start getting
>    married at younger ages. This results in a higher birth rate at
>    every wage level. Show this change on your graph by drawing a
>    second, dotted, birth rate line. Mark the new equilibria as b’,
>    d’, w’, and P’. Describe in words what happened to the
>    equilibrium wage level and population size.

> (Optional: check your pen-and-paper answer of 7 using the Malthus
> App.)

> *8. Imagine you are a ruler of a country with a Malthusian economy, 
meaning there is the usual Malthusian feedback relationship between birth 
rates, death rates, and wages. Suppose you face four policy choices below:
A. Introduce a vaccination program to rid your country of smallpox
B. Introduce free birth control
C. Institute an open-border policy for one year, allowing anyone who wants 
to immigrate to do so
D. Provide an in-kind “marriage subsidy” (like a free reception with cake) 
that makes marriage more attainable

> a) Which policy or policies could you choose if your only goal was to 
permanently increase the population size? Choose all that apply and explain 
your answer(s) for each in several sentences.


> b) Now identify one policy option from the list above that 
> does not achieve the goal of a permanent increase in population size. 
> Explain in a sentence or two how it affects population size in the short

Congratulations! You have completed Lab 2.



# Notes on possible extensions of this lab

Here are some possibilities for extending this analysis.

You don't have to do any of this, although you might want to read through 
both to get additional ideas and to put what we've done in context. 

* Analyze changes rather than levels. Since over the course of the
  demographic transition, the levels of both fertility and mortality
  fall, this creates some positive correlation in levels over time.
  One way to remove this time-trend effect is to look at differences
  rather than levels. Here is some sample code to get you started:
  
```{r}
b = B/N
d = D/N
db = diff(b)
dd = diff(d)
#### all periods
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
plot(db, dd, type = 'n')
text(db, dd, year)
title(round(cor(db, dd), 2))
#### now for sub-periods
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
s = year %in% 1751:1800
plot(db[s], dd[s], type = 'n')
text(db[s], dd[s], year[s])
title(round(cor(db[s], dd[s]), 2))
## you could see if correlation is
## still high removing outlier ...
s = year %in% 1801:1850
plot(db[s], dd[s], type = 'n')
text(db[s], dd[s], year[s])
title(round(cor(db[s], dd[s]), 2))
s = year %in% 1851:1900
plot(db[s], dd[s], type = 'n')
text(db[s], dd[s], year[s])
title(round(cor(db[s], dd[s]), 2))
s = year %in% 1901:1950
plot(db[s], dd[s], type = 'n')
text(db[s], dd[s], year[s])
title(round(cor(db[s], dd[s]), 2))
```

* Look at other countries, either in Human Mortality Database, for
  which there may be other countries with 19th century data, or
  elsewhere.

* Throughout, we have only looked at one half of the Malthusian dynamic:
  the potential effect of conditions (interpreted as wages) on births
  and deaths. The other half asserts that population size itself is
  what is driving the change in wages. How could this be looked at
  empirically? How have other researchers tried to answer this? Is
  there any way to get similar data and re-examine?
