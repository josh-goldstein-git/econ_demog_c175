In this lab we will look at patterns of intermarriage among
opposite-sex couples and more recent same-sex couples in
California. Our data come from the American Community Survey
from 2015. The Census recently changed its coding so that same-sex
married couples would not have their responses edited to
"non-married." (See
http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/29/census-says-it-will-count-same-sex-marriages-but-with-caveats/)

# Reading in data

```{r}

df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh-goldstein-git/econ_demog_c175_2023/main/data/ca_marriage_out.csv", as.is = T)
nrow(df)
## we see there are about 34,000 couples in our sample
```

Let's look at the variables
```{r}
head(df)
```
Each line is a couple. Variables ending in "_sp" are for the spouse of the person answering the questionnaire. Only one person per household filled out the questionnaire.

- 'x' is age in years
- 'college' takes the value "college" for those with a 4-year degree and "nocollege" for those without.
- 'racere' is a recode of a more detailed race variable into Asian ('a'), Black ('b'), and White ('w'). (Clearly, we're missing Latino/a folks, Middle Eastern/North African/Central Asian/Indian folks, and Native Americans, plus others!)

- 'wageinc' is wage income in the previous 12 months in dollars

To make our analysis easier, we've restricted the sample to
- California only
- respondents and spouses aged 19-59
- races: Asian, White and Black

Note that this sample also elides people outside of the gender or sex binary. There
are no options for non-binary, trans, or intersex identities.

Let's check to see if there are same sex marriages in the sample:
```{r}
head(df[df$sex == df$sex_sp,])
```
Yep! 
Let's save the variables in a form that's easier to type
```{r}
sex = df$sex
sex_sp = df$sex_sp # sex of spouse
age = df$x
age_sp = df$x_sp
college = df$college
college_sp = df$college_sp
incwage = df$incwage
incwage_sp = df$incwage_sp
race = df$racere
race_sp = df$racere_sp
```

# Measuring positive and negative assortative mating

## Correlation: for a continuous variable taking numeric vales

The correlation between two vectors of numbers $x$ and $y$ tell you how the x & y are "co-related". A value of 1 means that x and y are perfectly aligned, so that like is with like. A value of -1 means that they are negatively related, so that like and unlike pair together. A value of 0 means that they are unrelated to each other.

An example of zero correlation would be two independent sets of
randomly generated numbers
```{r}
set.seed(1)
x = rnorm(100)
y = rnorm(100)
plot(x,y)
title(paste("correlation is:", round(cor(x,y),3)))
```

An example of positive correlation
```{r}
 x = rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 30)
 epsilon = rnorm(length(x), mean = 0, sd = 25)
 y = x + epsilon
 plot(x,y)
 title(paste("correlation is:", round(cor(x,y),3)))
```

An example of negative correlation

```{r}
 x = rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 30)
 epsilon = rnorm(length(x), mean = 0, sd = 25)
 y = 300 -x + epsilon
 plot(x,y)
 title(paste("correlation is:", round(cor(x,y),3)))
```

Q1.1 What is NOT true about the correlation between married partners?

A. A negative value means opposites attract.

B. A positive value means like prefers like.

C. A value of 0.5 means that there is no tendency for married partners
to be similar.

D. A value of 0 means there is no tendency for married partners to be
similar.

# Measuring association in a 2x2 table

Correlation is useful for continuous numeric variables. Sometimes we
have variables that take on only two values, which we call binary. The
relationship between two binary variables can be summarized with the
odds ratio.

Say we have a 2x2 table of the sexes of spouses in California
```{r}
table(sex, sex_sp)
```

To measure the association we can calculate the odds ratio, which is
defined as
$$
\theta = {(F[1,1]/ F[1,2]) \over (F[2,1] / F[2,2])}
$$
In our case this would be
```{r} 
theta = (215/13402) / (20366/231)
print(theta) 
``` 

The odds-ratio can take values from 0 to positive
infinity. A value of 1 indicates a neutral relationship, with no
positive or negative sorting. A value close to 0 indicates very
negative sorting; high values (10, 100, or even 1000) indicate very
positive sorting.

The reason that this is called the odds-ratio is because the numerator
is the odds of being in cell [1,1] compared to [1,2], and the
denominator is odds of being in cell [2,1] compared to [2,2]. If there
were no tendency to marry one sex rather than the other, the odds of
marrying a "male" would be the same for females and males and the
ratio would be 1.


Here's an example of a table with an odds ratio of 1.

3  5
6  10

A value of $\theta > 1$ tells us that there is positive association,
as with a correlation greater than 0. An example would be

10 3
2  20

Q1.2: The odds ratio in this table is:
A. 200/ 6
B. 5 / 200
C. 20/ 60
D. 30 / 40

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.2 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.2)
```


A value of $\theta < 1$ tells us that there is negative
association. An example is our above table of spouses by sex in
California. We expect a number that is much less than 1, because we
know that most marriages in California are between people of opposite
sexes.

Here's a function to calculate the odds ratio
```{r}
get.odds.ratio <- function(my.table)
{
  if (!all(dim(my.table) == c(2,2)))
    stop("table needs to be 2x2")
  theta = (my.table[1,1]/ my.table[1,2]) / (my.table[2,1] / my.table[2,2])
  return(theta)
}
```

Let's check our calculation of the odds ratio of our table by sex
```{r}
sex.tab <- table(sex, sex_sp)
print(sex.tab)
sex.theta <- get.odds.ratio(sex.tab)
print(paste("theta = ", round(sex.theta, 5)))
```

Q1.3: Which of the following is true for the odds ratio found for the
table of marriages by combination of sex.
A. There's no tendency for marriages to be same- or opposite- sex. We
know this because the odds ratio is close to 0.
B. There's some tendency for marriages to be same-sex. We know this
because the odds ratio is positive.
C. There's a strong tendency for marriages to be opposite-sex. We know
this because the odds ratio is much less than 1.

# Sorting for opposite-sex married couples

Here we will look at assortative pairing for opposite-sex couples. At
the end of the lab, you will repeat this exercise for same-sex couples
to see if same-sex spouses appear to be more similar to each other (or
more different) than opposite-sex couples.

## 1. Education

Our variable "college" tells us if the person has a 4-year college
degree. The predictions from Becker's theory are ambiguous. On the one
hand, we would expect education to be associated with market wages,
which Becker thinks should be negatively correlated across spouses. On
the other hand, there are many reasons to think that education should
positively sort, including complementarity in investments in children
and complementary consumption (of books, films, and conversation). And
then there is the issue of search costs: since future spouses often
meet in an educational or work setting, and since these are highly
sorted by education, we might expect likes to marry likes simply out
of convenience, even if there were no preference for assortative
marriage in education.


In order to compare same-sex to opposite sex marriages, we create an index variable.

```{r}
ss <- sex == sex_sp ## index for "same sex" ("ss")  couples
os <- !ss ## index for "opposite sex" ("os") couples
```

We can now look at the association of education for opposite sex couples

Now we can construct two tables, one for the college status of
same-sex couples and one for the college status of opposite sex
couples

```{r}
college.tab.os <- table(college[os], college_sp[os])

print(college.tab.os)
print(get.odds.ratio(college.tab.os))
```

Q1.4: Would you agree or disagree with the following statement

> We see an odds ratio of 11.4, which is much bigger than one, showing
> strong positive sorting between opposite-sex spouses.

A. Agree
B. Disagree

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.4 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.4)
```


## 2. Age

We expect ages to be similar between spouses both because of the
relative ease of meeting people of one's own age group and also
because age will be correlated with a number of other traits including
cultural taste, political outlook, energy level, and other
characteristics that we would expect to positively sort.

```{r}
plot(head(age[os], 1000), head(age_sp[os], 1000)) # we only plot first 1000 points
title(paste("ages of spouses, correlation:", round(cor(age[os], age_sp[os]),3)))
```

## 3. Wage income
```{r}
plot(head(incwage[os], 1000), head(incwage_sp[os], 1000))
title(paste("wage income of spouses, correlation:",
            round(cor(incwage[os], incwage_sp[os]),3)))
```

Note: The data is top-coded, so that all values above a certain level
are assigned the same value, in this case $483,000, which is the
average of the top-coded values.

Here we see a more complicated story. We see a large number of points
in which one of the spouses has zero income and the other a positive
income, so this is consistent with the specialization argument of
Becker. But overall there is no strong positive or negative
relationship.

We could plot only couples where both partners had income greater than
zero.
```{r}
both_nonzero = incwage > 0 & incwage_sp > 0
plot(head(incwage[os & both_nonzero], 1000),
     head(incwage_sp[os & both_nonzero], 1000))
title(paste("wage income of spouses, correlation:",
            round(cor(incwage[os & both_nonzero],
                      incwage_sp[os & both_nonzero]),3)))
```
But Becker would probably say this is uninformative, since where there
are big differences in potential earnings, one spouse will choose to
specialize in home production and have zero earnings. So if we leave
out the zero earners, we're missing the important part of the story.


Perhaps a better test would be to see if zero earnings tend to be only
in one spouse.

```{r} 
zerowage = incwage == 0 
zerowage_sp = incwage_sp == 0
zerowage.tab.os <- table(zerowage, zerowage_sp)
print(zerowage.tab.os)
print(get.odds.ratio(zerowage.tab.os))
```

Surprisingly, we get an odds ratio close to 1. So even here, we don't
see negative assortative marriage. We could further refine the
analysis, say by considering people of a particular age range. But the
bigger point is probably that potential wages before marriage, not
observed wages after marriage, are probably what people are
considering when they choose a spouse. Education is a great measure of
potential wages, because it is observed both for those in and out of
the labor force.

## 3. Race

Our data set has been restricted to people who identify as Asian
("a"), Black ("b"), or White ("w"). In order to calculate the
association, we will consider three possible 2x2 combinations ("a" &
"w"), ("b" & "w"), and ("a" & "b")

First we make our tables of the race of spouses of each 2x2 combination:

```{r}
os.wb <- os & race %in% c("w", "b") & race_sp %in% c("w", "b")
os.wa <- os & race %in% c("w", "a") & race_sp %in% c("w", "a")
os.ab <- os & race %in% c("b", "a") & race_sp %in% c("b", "a")
race.wb.tab.os <- table(race[os.wb], race_sp[os.wb])
print(race.wb.tab.os)
race.wa.tab.os <- table(race[os.wa], race_sp[os.wa])
print(race.wa.tab.os)
race.ab.tab.os <- table(race[os.ab], race_sp[os.ab])
print(race.ab.tab.os)
```

We see that most marriages in all three tables are "same race". But it
is hard to tell by looking at the numbers which pairs of races have
the highest tendency to in-marry and inter-marry. For this we use the
odds-ratio.

```{r}
print(get.odds.ratio(race.wb.tab.os))
```
```{r}
print(get.odds.ratio(race.wa.tab.os))
```
```{r}
print(get.odds.ratio(race.ab.tab.os))
```

So it appears that crossing the White-Asian racial divide is easier
than crossing the White-Black racial divide, and both are easier than
crossing the Asian-Black racial divide.


## Conclusions for opposite-sex spouses

Our findings are consistent with Becker's statements about positive
sorting by race, age, and education, but not particularly supportive
of the negative assortative pattern he predicted (in the 1970s) for
market wages.


# Same-sex couples

Becker's main interest is in explaining why opposite-sex couples form. But his theory has implications for same-sex couples. He writes

> Households with only men or only women are less efficient because
> they are unable to profit from the sexual difference in comparative
> advantage.

> Source: Becker (1991), _Treatise_on_the_Family_, p. 37-38, cited by Jepsen and Jepsen(2001).

This inability to "profit from the sexual difference in comparative
advantage" could mean that same-sex couples would seek to profit more
from non-sexual differences, perhaps in demographic characteristics
like age or education. Or it might mean that same-sex couples may
derive their utility less from comparative advantages in production
and more from complementarities in consumption.

Another factor to think about is limited choice. If one is looking for
a partner in a large pool, then it may be easier to find exactly what
one wants. On the other hand, if there is a decisive constraint --
like the person must be over 6 feet tall or the person must be
interested in a same-sex marriage -- then a less than ideal match on
another characteristic might well be worth it.

# Replicating our analysis for same-sex couples

We can use the "ss" index we created to look at assortative marriage patterns for same sex couples. For example, for education, we can calculate

```{r}
college.tab.ss <- table(college[ss], college_sp[ss])
print(college.tab.ss) 
print(get.odds.ratio(college.tab.ss))
```

We see that our odds ratio of 6.7 for same sex couples is much less
than the odds ratio of 11.4 observed for opposite-sex couples. This
means that there appears to be a greater tendency to cross educational
divides for same-sex couples.

# Graded Questions

0. Do you expect same-sex marriage spouses to be more like each other
   or less like each other than opposite-sex spouses? Is your
   expectation the same for age, race, income and education? If not,
   specify further. Explain your reasoning. Make sure to write down
   somewhere your expectations BEFORE you do the analysis. (You won't
   be graded on this. The goal is for you to get the most out of your
   data analysis and to prevent you from coming up with a purely post
   hoc explanation after you've seen the result.)


1. Replicate our analysis of opposite-sex marriages for same-sex
   marriages. Complete the (5) cells marked "X" in the following
   table. Transfer your answers to bCourses.

Characteristic|  Opposite-sex | Same-sex    | Opposite-sex | Same-sex
--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------
Measure       | odds ratio    | odds ratio  | correlation  | correlation
--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------
Education     | 11.4          | 6.7         |              |
Race ("a","b")| 2354          | X           |              |
Race ("w","b")| 531           | X           |              |
Race ("w","a")| 218           | X           |              |
Wage Income   |               |             | 0.03         | X
Age           |               |             | 0.86         | X



2. How does positive sorting differ for same-sex spouses, compared to
   opposite-sex spouses? (For example, "The smaller odds ratios for
   education mean that same-sex marriages sort less positively on
   education than do opposite-sex
   marriages."). [Describe the remaining 5 relationships in a sentence each.]


3. Describe a potential explanation for the pattern of your results.
   Try to use the words "complementarity" and "comparative advantage"
   in your answer. If some characteristics sort more and some less,
   try to make sense of the pattern. (There is no wrong explanation
   here. Just make sure your explanation is consistent with your
   evidence.) [ < 75 words]


4.  We didn't distinguish same-sex *male* couples from same-sex
    *female* couples. If we did, which would you expect to have a less
    positive correlation in wage income: same-sex female couples or
    same-sex male couples? Explain briefly why. [ < 25 words] (Hint:
    you don't need to calculate anything, just explain your
    logic. There is no single right answer.)


5.  Let's extend the example we did in class (on about slide 20 of the
lecture on assortative pairing). Let the payoffs have the form
$$
Z(F_i, M_j) = (F_i^r + M_j^r)^{1/r}
$$
and let $F_1 = M_1 = 1$, $F_2 = M_2 = 4$, and $F_3 = M_3 = 5$, with 
$r=3$. Here the subscripts $1,2,3$ refer to the levels of some characteristic,
which could be income, personality type, ethnic background, religion,
education, height, or anything else. When a marriage is formed of
people with the same-subscript, they have the same value of the
characteristic, as we can see from the assignments made above.

a) Fill in missing cells of the $3 \times 3$ matrix of payoffs.

	   M1    M2    M3
F1  1.26
F2
F3

b) What would be the optimal sorting? (Hint: choose the sorting
that maximizes the sum of the payoff of all three marriages.) Is this
an example of "like marrying like," or is this an example of
"opposites attracting"?


c) Tell a story of why the marriage pattern might look this way if the
characteristic were "college major" and the two options were (1) art history and
(2) economics. (For example, if the example showed likes marrying likes, 
then you would want to give a reason why a marriage of people who both studied 
economics would have a higher "payoff" than a marriage where one partner majored 
in economics and one majored in art history.) Please limit your answer to a
few sentences.
