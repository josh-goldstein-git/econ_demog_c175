Fertility and an Investigation of Historical Switzerland"
output: html_notebook
---


In this lab, we first go further into the cost-of-time model of
fertility, answering questions based on theory and experimentation
with the cost_of_time "app". Then, we look at fertility and
socio-economic data from historical cross-section provinces in
French-speaking Switzerland, trying to see how our models may or may
not be consistent with historical experience.

# Part 1. Implications of the Cost-of-Time Model of Fertility Choice



The Cost_of_time app computes the optimal bundle (N, X) of N children
and X-dollars worth of consumer goods. The app plots two choices, one
based on the initial values of $(w, p, c, and I)$ and one for separate
values $(w', p', c', and I')$. The app is available at

```{r}
browseURL("https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjosh-goldstein-git%2Fecon_demog_c175&urlpath=shiny%2Fecon_demog_c175%2FShinyApps%2Fcost-of-time%2F&branch=main&targetPath=ShinyApps/econ_demog_c175")

```
under cost_of_time. 
We recommend resizing the window of the app and playing with the font
size (cmd-shift+, cmd-shift- on a mac) until the graph is fairly
square.

You can see the effect of changing any single value by changing any
one of the "Parameters to perturb."

You can see how the effect of these changes (e.g., increasing wages)
depends on the values of the other parameters by first changing the
initial parameter values, and then changing one of the "Parameters to
perturb".


## Background to the Model

We imagine potential parents choosing between the number of children
they want to have and the amount of "other goods" they want to
consume.

### Prices

For simplicity, we let there just be one kind of "other goods", which
we denote $X$. And we let the price be 1 dollar per unit of $X$.


The price of children has two components:

1. A fixed dollar expenditure per child $p$ for food, clothing, shelter,
schooling, toys, etc.

2. A time cost of $c$ hours per child. This dollar value of the time
cost depends on the parents wage.

### Income and the Budget Constraint

Parents face a budget constraint. Their household income consists of
'outside income' $I$ and wage income $w L = w (T - c N)$.

1. 'Outside income' $I$ includes sources like interest on assets,
   inheritance, as well as the wage-earnings of someone who cannot
   spend their time with children.

2. Wage income is the hourly wage rate $w$ times the number of hours
   worked $L$. The number of hours worked is equal to the total time
   available for work $T$, minus the hours spent taking care of
   children. (In our simple model, there is no leisure.)

If we assume we are studying a heteronormative nuclear family with a 
1950's-style division of labor, such that men never take care of 
children and women divide their time between child-care and market work,
then one could think of $I$ as "men's earnings" and $w (T- c N)$ as 
"women's earnings."

The family's expenditures must satisfy the budget constraint
$$
\mbox{Income} = \mbox{Consumption}.
$$
In our model, this means
$$
I + w (T- c N) = X + p N.
$$
We can re-arrange as
$$
I + w T = X + (p + c w) N,
$$
where the left-hand side is now "Full Income" and the right hand side
gives the consumption including the time-cost of children. The full
cost per child is thus $p + c w$.

### Utility

The choice of how many children and how much "other goods" is made so
as to make the parents as happy as possible. We can use the same
Cobb-Douglas formulation that we used for production functions earlier
in the semester as a convenient model for utility. We let the utility
of a particular choice of $X$ and $N$ be
$$
U(X,N) = X^a N^{1-a},
$$
where $0 < a < 1$.

### The Optimal 'Bundle' of Goods

Parents will choose $X$ and $N$ to maximize $U$, subject to their
budget constraint. There are many methods for solving this constrained
optimization problem, including:

* Numerical search. (We try all combinations of X and N that satisfy
  the budget constraint). This is what we did in class.

* Substitution. We rewrite our budget constraint so that we express
  one variable in terms of another. Then we substitute this expression
  into the utility function and maximize utility of this single
  variable function. (We will do this below.)

* Lagrange multipliers. This is a general method for constrained
  optimization. Good to know, but beyond the mathematics we're using
  in this course.

### Solving for the Optimum by Substitution

The purpose of showing the derivation is to give you a sense of how
this is done. You don't need to be able to do this yourselves.

1. Express $X$ in terms of $N$.

From the budget constraint,
$$
I + w T = X + (p + c w) N,
$$
we can write
$$
X = (I + w T) - (p + cw) N
$$

2. Substitute into $U$

$$
U(X,N) = X^a N^{1-a},
$$
$$
U(X,N) = U(N) =  \left[ (I + wT) - (p + cw) N \right]^a N^{1-a}
$$

3. Maximization (the rate of change at the optimum should be zero)

At the maximum, $U'(N) = 0$. But it is a bit easier to work with
$\log U$, which will reach a maximum at the same value of $N$.

$$
\log U(N) = a\log{ \left[(I + wT) - (p + cw) N \right]} + (1-a)\log N
$$

$$
{d\log U(N) \over d N} = {-a (p + cw) \over
\left[(I + wT) - (p + cw) N \right]} + {(1-a) \over N}
$$

When ${d\log U(N) \over d N} = 0$,
$$
{(1-a) \over N} = {a (p + cw) \over
\left[(I + wT) - (p + cw) N \right]}
$$

4. Solving for the optimal values

Solving for $N$ gives us
$$
N^* = (1 - a) {I + w T \over p + cw}.
$$

We obtain $X^*$, by substituting $N^*$ into our earlier expression.
$$
X^* = (I + w T) - (p + cw) N^* = (I + w T) - (1-a)(I + w T) = a (I + w T).
$$
(Because of the properties of the Cobb-Douglas utility function, the
amount of $X$ chosen depends only on full income and is independent of
the price of children.)

### Analysis of the solution

With our solution
$$
N^* = (1 - a) {I + w T \over p + cw}
$$
in hand, we can now ask what effect changes in any of the parameters
will have on the choice of $N$.

For example, increasing $a$ will clearly reduce $N^*$. We can write
$$
{\partial N \over \partial a} < 0
$$

(The symbol $\partial$ indicates a partial derivative, differentiating
only with respect to one variable.)

Likewise, we can see that
$$
{\partial N \over \partial I} > 0
$$

And since $p$ and $c$ are both in the denominator,
$$
{\partial N \over \partial c} < 0
$$
and
$$
{\partial N \over \partial p} < 0
$$.

The only effect that is ambiguous in sign is
$$
{\partial N \over \partial w} \lessgtr 0
$$.

Some additional mathematical manipulation shows that

$$
{\partial N \over \partial w} <  0, \mbox{ when } {T\over c} < {I \over p}.
$$.

So, while in class, we questioned the usefulness of the cost-of-time
model in making predictions about the effect of a wage increase on
fertility, we see here that the model makes clear predictions about
the other variables. Increases in outside income $I$ unambiguously
increase fertility. Increases in the price of children through $c$ or
$p$ unambiguously reduce fertility. And changes in taste, by changing
the relative preferences $a$ for children vs. goods, are also
unambiguous in their effect.

For the purposes of this class, you do not need to be able to follow
every step in the mathematical derivation. What is important to
understand is that it is possible to analyze this model and discover
in a quite general way what predictions the model makes and what the
limits of the model are. The tractability of the model is what makes
it so useful for enhancing our understanding.

$c$, and $I$ unchanged. (Tip: you can always refresh your browser to return

# Part 2. Fertility Decline in Switzerland

In this homework, we take advantage of the wonderful coincidence that
R has a built in data set from the literature on the historical
demographic transition. The dataset has fertility, mortality, and a
number of economic and social indicators for 47 French-speaking
provinces of Switzerland in the years around 1888.

The goal of this homework is to see empirically what the determinants
of lower fertility appear to be -- and to see which of our economic
theories seem to be applicable in this case.

# 2. Theoretical Expectations

Before analyzing the Swiss data, the first questions ask you to
write down what you expect the relationship between fertility and the
other variables. Use the cost-of-time model, Becker's quantity-quality
model, or your own independent reasoning to provide the reasons for
your prediction.


Here is a model answer to show the format to use for the
other parts.

Infant mortality

(Prediction: Higher infant mortality would be associated with higher
fertility. My reasoning is that it would discourage investments in
child quality by making the price of quality per surviving child
high. So parents would have many, "low" investment children, rather
than few, "high" investment children.)
