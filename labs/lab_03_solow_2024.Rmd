# Overview

In this lab we will work with the neo-classical growth model developed
by Solow and Swann. Our goals are:

1. To derive some analytical properties of the model, assuming a
   Cobb-Douglas production function.

2. To understand the dynamics of income and savings using a
   simulation app.

3. To understand how the capital intensification may or may not lead
   to increasing inequality, depending on the nature of the production
   function.

The order of this lab will be slightly different in that we will start
with some mathematical derivations and then go on to do some computing
afterwards.

(In order to display the equations, you may need to click on them with
the mouse.)

# 1. Introduction

In the Solow model, the capital per worker and output per worker are
in their steady state when investment exactly balances population
growth and depreciation. This is when
$$
s y(k) = (n+d) k.
$$

# 2. Analytical questions

Note: In this lab, we are beginning with some analytic,
pencil-and-paper problems. You'll turn these in later as your answers
to problems 1, 2, & 3.


1. Let the production function be Cobb-Douglas, with $y(k)=k^{0.3}$.
Assume that the savings rate is 25 percent, population growth is 1
percent, and depreciation is 4 percent. 

(Technical note: The production function often has a constant "A",
such that $y(k) = A*k^\alpha$. For simplicity we omit this term, or,
equivalently, assume A = 1.)

For example, for the steady-state level of capital per worker, we
substitute the production function $y(k) = k^a$ into the steady-state
condition above to give

$$
s y(k) = s k^\alpha = (n+d) k
$$

Re-arranging, then gives us a formula for capital per work k in the steady state:

$$
\left( s \over {n + d} \right)^{1 \over {1-\alpha} } = k
$$

You can then substitute the values given in the problem and provide
your numerical answer.

a) What is the steady-state level of capital per worker?

b) What is the steady-state of output per worker?

c) What is the steady-state level of consumption per worker?


2. Now assume population growth is instead -0.5 % (approximately the
   growth rate when every couple has 1.7 children), but that all other
   parameters stay the same.

a) What is the new steady-state output per worker? Is it higher or
   lower than with faster population growth?  [A numerical answer and 1
   sentence response is fine.]

b) What is the new steady-state of consumption per worker? Is it
   higher or lower than with faster population growth? [A numerical
   answer and 1 sentence response is fine.]


# 3. Questions with the App

For the following question, you may find it useful to experiment with
the "Solow" app available at:
```{r}
browseURL("https://berkeley-demog.shinyapps.io/solow/")
```
(You can also use the app to get a rough check your answers to the
analytical questions above.)

Assume your initial parameters are the default s, n, d, alpha, d, and
k values on the app.

3. Assume a technological innovation, like the availability of
   electricity, increases output per person at all levels of the
   capital/labor ratio by 30% (You can implement this in the app by
   moving the slider on "Output level y'" from 1 to 1.3).

a) Describe in words what happens in the short run to output. (E.g.,
   how large is the immediate increase in output?) [ 1 sentence ]

b) Describe in words what happens in the long-run. (If the long-run
   steady state is higher than the short-term level of output right
   after the technology change, what is causing this additional
   increase?) [2 sentences]
   
# 4. Growth and Inequality (skip this year)

(Note: We're going to skip this section this year, but you are welcome
 to do as self-study, especially if you're an econ major.)

In this part of the lab we will use R to calculate the shares of
income from capital and from labor using two different production
functions. In a competitive market, the returns to capital and labor
are equal to their marginal product. In our case, we are working with
per capita income, so the only variable is the amount of capital per
worker, k. The derivative ("change") of the production with respect to
k is the marginal product and the rate of return of capital.

## i. Cobb-Douglas

Here we use a production function of the form

$$
y(k) = k^\alpha
$$

```{r}
k <- seq(1, 20, .1)
alpha <- 1/3
y.of.k <- k^alpha
## numerical slope = rises/runs
mp.k.numeric = diff(y.of.k)/diff(k)
plot(k[-1], mp.k.numeric)
## analytic derivative, taking derivative of k^alpha with respect to
## k.  (don't worry about this if you haven't had calculus)
mp.k.analytic = alpha * k^(alpha - 1)
lines(k, mp.k.analytic, col = "red", lwd = 2)
## we see they match quite well
```

Q1.1 Is the marginal product on capital
A. Constant with increases in capital
B. Rising  with increases in capital
C. Declining with increases in capital

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.1 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.1)
```

Now let's see what happens to capital's share of total output. We
assume here that the rate of return is equal to its marginal
product. So as we increase the capital per person, we will have two
countervailing forces: the amount of capital will increase, but the
rate of return will decrease. Let's see what effect dominates or if
the two effects cancel each other out.

```{r}
mp.k <- mp.k.analytic
output.from.capital.per.worker <- mp.k * k
total.output.per.worker <- y.of.k
output.from.labor.per.worker <- y.of.k - mp.k * k
capital.share <- mp.k * k / y.of.k
```

Now let's see what happens to capital share as we increase k
```{r}
plot(k, capital.share)
```

Q1.2 Does the capital share of income
A. Rise with increases in capital
B. Stay constant with increases in capital
D. Fall with increases in capital

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.2 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.2)
```

## ii. An alternative production function

Let's modify the Cobb-Douglas production function slightly so that it
is

$$
y(k) = k^\alpha + k/10
$$

Modify the code below to work with this new production
function. (Hint: the derivative with respect to k of $k^\alpha + k/10$
is $\alpha * k^{\alpha-1} + 1/10.$)


```{r}
k <- seq(1, 20, .1)
alpha <- 1/3
y.of.k <- (k^alpha) #<--- MODIFY THIS LINE.
## numerical slope = rises/runs
mp.k.numeric = diff(y.of.k)/diff(k)
plot(k[-1], mp.k.numeric)
## analytic derivative, taking derivatitive of k^alpha with respect to k.
## (don't worry about this if you haven't had calculus)
mp.k.analytic = alpha * k^(alpha - 1) ### <--- MODIFY THIS LINE, TOO!
lines(k, mp.k.analytic, col = "red", lwd = 2)
## you should see that they match quite well
```

Q2.1 Is the marginal product on capital still declining
A. Yes, but perhaps less quickly
B. No, it is no longer declining

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer2.1 = NA
quiz.check(answer2.1)
```

Now let's see what happens to capital's share of total output.

```{r}
## Note: here the variables carry over from the previous chunk. So, as
## long as you have executed all of the chunks up to here, they will
## be from the 2nd production function.
mp.k <- mp.k.analytic
output.from.capital.per.worker <- mp.k * k
total.output.per.worker <- y.of.k
output.from.labor.per.worker <- y.of.k - mp.k * k
capital.share <- mp.k * k / y.of.k
## graph our result to see what happens to capital share as we
## increase k
plot(k, capital.share)
```

Q2.2 Does the capital share of income
A. Rise with increases in capital
B. Stay constant with increases in capital
C. Fall with increases in capital

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer2.2 = NA
quiz.check(answer2.2)
```

# Part 5: Lab write up.

1. (Question 1 in the analytical section at the beginning of lab)

2. (Question 2 in the analytical section at the beginning of lab)

3. (Question 3 in the questions with the app section above)

4. What level of population growth would maximize income per capita?
   Is this a plausible goal for a society? (Hint:you don't need
   calculus for this problem. Try thinking about it with a diagram.)
   [1 or 2 sentences is enough here.]



5.  Presume that the world is not-so-cobb-douglass and the true
production function for our economy is as follows:
$$
y(k) = k^\alpha + k/5
$$
Modify the code from section ii "Alternative production functions" 
that you previously wrote (lines 217-229) to answer quizify question 2.1 
to reflect this new production function. 
 

Is the marginal product of capital:

A. Rising with increasing k

B. Declining with increasing k 

C. Constant with changes in k

D. MP rises at first but then falls as k increases 


6.  Now, modify the code you wrote to answer quizify question 2.2
(lines 243-255) and generate a plot to answer the following question:
Based on the new production function from question 5, what is the approximate capital share of income when k=10? 
(numerical answer read off the chart axes, approximation okay)



## Immigration

A country is considering two immigration policies. What would Solow's
model predict for each of these policies? (Note: both of these
examples leave out consideration of the human capital of migrants,
which in a more realistic model could be important.)

7. Allow a one-time wave of super-rich immigrants, who bring
   significantly greater amounts of capital per person than 
   the native population. What would happen to per capita
   income in the short and long-run? (Hint: think about the time path
   of $k$) [Answer in a sentence or two.]

8. Allow a one-time wave of penniless immigrants who bring no capital
   at all. What would happen to per capita income in the short and
   long run? (Hint: think about the time path of $k$). [Answer in a
   sentence or two.]

Congratulations! You are finished with Lab 3.
