# Chinese Fertility, Sex-Ratios and the 1-child policy

In this lab we will look at results from the 1990 census. A 1% sample
of the census has been made available by the IPUMS International
project at the University of Minnesota. We've created a 10% sample of
this 1% sample (a 1 in 1,000 sample) and prepared it for you. The data
set is quite large, covering about 200,000 households.

We saw that, at the aggregate, the 1-child policy did not cause major
changes in the level of fertility. However, we may be able to detect
more subtle changes. Chinese parents may have reacted to the 1-CP not
by reducing the number of children but by trying to influence the sex
of their children either by sex-selective abortion, hiding girls when
the census take came, or trying for another child when they only had
girls (taking advantage of exceptions to the 1-CP).

In this lab we look at the sex-ratio at birth and how parents
decisions to have more children may have depended on the sex
composition of the children they already have. Using the 1990 census,
we will also try to see if Chinese couples became more strategic
regarding the sex of their children after the introduction of the
1-child policy in 1979.


Our goals in this analysis are

1. To look for signs of sex-preference based on the birth order and
sex composition of the children that have been born

2. To see if the 1-child policy may have amplified son-preference.

We will look at the following indicators:

* Sex ratios of surviving children by year of birth to see
if births became more masculine after the 1-child policy.

* Sex ratios by birth order (and year of birth) to see if higher
order births are more likely to be boys.

* "Parity progression" by sex composition of children already born.

(Parity is the number of births a woman has had. So a woman of parity
3 has had 3 births. The parity progression ratio is defined as
$PPR_i$, probability of having a child of order $i+1$ among women of parity
$i$. So, if $PPR_3 = .2$ it means that 20 percent of women who have 3
children "progress" to having a 4th birth.)

An "NA" means "not applicable" or "not available". Here an "NA" in
age2 means there was only 1 child, and an "NA" in age3, following a
number for age2 means there were only 2 children. (The same applies to
NAs in sex2 and sex3).

We have listed only the first 3 births (omitting all higher order
births). We have also dropped all of the households with zero
children.

# Part 1. The proportion female (by age and birth order)

We begin by looking at the proportion female $\pi_f$ by age in 1990
and by birth order.

Our hypotheses is that the 1-child policy might have caused the
proportion of female births to decline. It may have also encouraged
underreporitng of surviving girls. Differential mortality and
infanticide are not thought to be major causes of sex differences in
surviving children.

Let's first look at the proportion female $\pi_f$ by age in 1990

```{r}

get.prop.female <- function(sex)
{
    ## this function takes a vector of sexes ("m" and "f")
    ## and computes the proportion female
    round(prop.table(table(sex[!is.na(sex)]))["f"],4)
    ## Technical note: this is the original version of this function, which
    ## should now work fine since all the empty strings "" in the
    ## 'sex' variable have been read-in as "NA".
}

## usage example:

pi.1 <- get.prop.female(sex = sex1)     # returns proportion oldest
print(pi.1)                             # children (1st births that
                                        # are girls


age.vec = 0:15                          # this is a vector of ages in
                                        # 1990 that we are interested
                                        # in. We loop through these
                                        # values.

pi.1.by.age.vec <- NULL             # initialize a vector for storing
                                        # proportion female (pi) of
                                        # 1st births by age of oldest
                                        # child (1st birth)

## now we loop through the ages and get proportion female by age in 1990

for (i in 1:length(age.vec))
{
    this.age = age.vec[i]
    pi.1.by.age.vec[i] <- get.prop.female(sex1[age1 == this.age])
}

print(pi.1.by.age.vec)
```
And plot results
```{r}
plot(age.vec, pi.1.by.age.vec,
     type = "l",
     ylim = c(.4, .6))
abline(v = 10, lty = 2) # approximate begining of 1-CP (1990 - 10 =
                        # 1980 = about 9 months after 1-CP introduction

abline(h = .5, lty = 2)

Q1.1 We were expecting ...

A. $\pi_f$ to increase with age, because fewer girls would be born (or reported)
after the 1-CP.

B. $\pi_f$ to decrease with age, because fewer girls would be born (or reported)
after the 1-CP.

C. No change in $\pi_f$ because $\pi$-day was last week and $\pi$ always
equals 3.14...

> Let's see if the same suprising trend holds true for 2nd births.

We have copied and pasted the relevant code above to calculate
"pi.2.by.age.vec" and plot this on the same graph using the following
commands. Insert your name using the text function in the upper
left. For the graded questions you will submit a copy of this graph.

```{r}
pi.2.by.age.vec <- NULL             # initialize a vector for storing
                                        # proportion female (pi) of
                                        # 1st births by age of oldest
                                        # child (1st birth)

## now we loop through the ages and get proportion female by age in 1990
for (i in 1:length(age.vec))
{
    this.age = age.vec[i]
    pi.2.by.age.vec[i] <- get.prop.female(sex2[age2 == this.age])

Q1.2 The 1-CP appears to have ...

A. Reduced the proportion female of 1st births.

B. Reduced the proportion female of 2nd births.

C. Reduced the proportion female of 2nd children reported in the
census

D. Done nothing. There is no trend in $\pi_2$ by age.

E. It's complicated. In order to see something, we need to consider
the difference in proportion female between 1st and 2nd births, 
before and after the 1 child policy.

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer0.3 = NA
quiz.check(answer0.3)
```



## Sex ratio by birth order (and age)

To finish up this part of the analysis let's look to see

1. If the proportion female declines with birth order (without
accounting for age)

2. If the proportion female declines with birth order and with the 1-CP
(accounting for age)

### Without age:

```{r}
print("sex1")
pi.1 = get.prop.female(df$sex1)
print(pi.1)
print("sex2")
pi.2 = get.prop.female(df$sex2)
print(pi.2)
print("sex3")
## insert command for pi.3 = in next line

# print(pi.3) # un-comment this line to print
```

Q1.3 What happens to the proportion female by birth order.

A. It falls consistently, indicating more sex-selection in favor of
sons for higher-order births.

B. It falls consistently, indicating more sex-selection (or under-reporting)
in favor of sons for higher-order births. 

C. There is no clear pattern

D. It falls from 1st to 2nd births, but rises for 3rd births.

```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer0.4 = NA
quiz.check(answer0.4)
```

### With age:

Here we cut-and-paste the code above to create "pi.2.by.age.vec" and
"pi.3.by.age.vec"

```{r}
## insert code here for creating pi.2.by.age.vec
```

```{r}
## insert code here for plotting pi.1.age.vec, pi.2.by.age.vec, and
## pi.3.age.vec all on same graph (with pi.3.age.vec in "blue")
```

Q1.4 What does adding 3rd births do to the story?

A. Not much. The pattern is too noisy.

B. It re-inforces what we've already found, that there is
sex-selection for higher births that might have increased after 1-CP

C. It contradicts what we've already found.

D. Nothing. $pi$ is always 3.14 ....

> For discussion (No auto-correct answers available.) 

# Part 2. A closer look. How the decision to have another child
# depends on sex of children already born.

The evidence we have looked at above is fairly indirect, averaging
across all families. We saw that the higher order births were more
likely to be boys than girls.

We can go further and look at variation between households. We can
take advantage of the fact that the first child is
sometimes a boy and sometimes a girl and see if those who have a girl
are more likely to "try again" for a boy.

## Parity progression to 2, based on sex of birth 1.

We now calculate $PPR1$ (the progression from parity 1 to a second
birth). We do this twice, once for those whose first child was a boy
and once for those whose first child was a girl. We include age of the
1st child so that we take into account that it takes time to have a
conceive and give birth to a 2nd child.

We show how to do this in full for 2nd births. For your assignment you
will look at 3rd births.

```{r}

get.ppr.by.parity <- function(nkids, parity)
{
    num = sum(nkids > parity)          # number of hh in nkids vec that
                                        # have another birth

    denom = length(nkids)               # number of hh in nkids vector
    ppr = num/denom
    return(ppr)
}


ppr1.sex1f.vec = NULL               # ppr for families with sex1 = "f"
ppr1.sex1m.vec = NULL               # ppr for families with sex1 = "m"

for (i in 1:length(age.vec))
{
    this.age = age.vec[i]
    ppr1.sex1f.vec[i] <- get.ppr.by.parity(nkids[sex1 == "f" &
                                                 age1 == this.age],
                                           parity = 1)
    ppr1.sex1m.vec[i] <- get.ppr.by.parity(nkids[sex1 == "m" &
                                                 age1 == this.age],
                                           parity = 1)
}

```

Now let's plot
```{r}
plot(age.vec, ppr1.sex1f.vec,
     col = "pink", lwd = 3, type = "l",
     ylab = "ppr1",
     xlab = "age1",
     main = "Parity progression from 1 to 2, by sex of 1st child")
lines(age.vec, ppr1.sex1m.vec, col = "blue", lwd = 3, type = "l")
abline(v = 10, lty = 2)
```

Q2.1 Does this make sense?

A. Yes, it means that those with a female first born are more likely
to try again.

B. Yes, it means that those with a female first born are less likely
to try again.

C. No, the gap shouldn't disappear for the younger children, since
that is after the 1 child policy

> For discussion (No auto-correct answers available.) 

The age of the first child is influenced both by "period effects" from
the year of birth and by "age effects" on the time it takes to have
another child. We can remove the age effect somewhat by looking at the
ratio of ppr by sex of the first born.

```{r}

ratio.of.ppr.vec = ppr1.sex1f.vec/ppr1.sex1m.vec
plot(age.vec, ratio.of.ppr.vec,
     xlab = "age1",
     main = "Ratio of PPR1 for families with first born daughter \n vs. 1st born son")
abline(v = 10, lty = 2)
```

Q2.2 What conclusion do we draw?

A. We should ignore the data point for age1 equals zero, since there
has been too little time to have a 2nd birth.

B. Having a girl 1st encourages, on average, Chinese parents to try
again.

C. The effects of son preference are largely stable over time

D. There is a slight suggestion that that the effect of son preference
is stronger after the 1-CP

E. All of the above.
